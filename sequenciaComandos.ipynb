            "\n",
            "9. **Verify Requests in Person**: If in doubt, contact the institution or company directly using a verified phone number or website, not the one provided in the suspicious email.\n",

This can lead to unauthorized access to databases, data theft, data corruption, or even complete takeover of the affected system. SQL Injection exploits occur when user input is not properly sanitized or validated, allowing attackers to execute malicious SQL code within the application's database.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here's an example of how an SQL Injection attack might work:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. An attacker identifies a vulnerable input field in a web application, such as a login form.\n",
            "2. The attacker inputs malicious SQL code into the input field, such as `1' OR '1'='1`.\n",
            "3. The web application processes the input and constructs a SQL query based on the input provided.\n",
            "4. The malicious SQL code alters the query, causing it to always evaluate to true.\n",
            "5. The web application executes the altered query, granting unauthorized access to the database or allowing the attacker to retrieve sensitive information.\n",
            "\n",
            "To prevent SQL Injection attacks, developers should use parameterized queries, input validation, and proper error handling. These techniques help ensure that user input is treated as data rather than executable code, and that only valid and expected data is processed by the application. Additionally, regularly updating and patching database systems can help mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n",
